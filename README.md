# Data Monetisation
We propose a data monetization architecture for leveraging the automotive radar data based on the Substrate blockchain framework. The architecture is designed to enable a virtuous economic cycle involving the Radar automotive data for the consortium members of Automotive enterprises, Vehicle owners, as well as Radar Equipment manufacturers. The data represented as Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is sourced from the vehicle owners by the Radar component manufacturers and enhanced upon them. It is offered as a service (NFT) back to the vehicle owners completing the virtuous economic loop. All the participant interactions are monetized and incentivized by dynamic pricing and commission sharing. Data interactions are certified for integrity as well as reviews for each NFT are maintained in the blockchain. Architecture respects the fairness, privacy concerns, as well as fidelity aspects. Architecture is implemented in the Substrate Blockchain framework and tested for hybrid consensus scalability of Proof of Authority algorithms. The algorithms evaluated are Aura and BABE along with GRANDPA for block authoring and finalization respectively in a cloud-based implementation that suits the enterprise consortium networks.
